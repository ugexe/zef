=head2 More CLI

=head4 B<install> [*@identities]

Note: The install process does not install anything until all other phases have completed. So if A requires B,
and a user has requested to C<install A>, it would download A and B, possibly Build A and B, test A and B,
and then finally install A and B but only if A and B passed all their tests. For instance: if A failed its
tests then B will not be installed (even if it passed its own tests) without force.

[C<@identities>] can be in the form of a file path (starting with B<.> or B</>), URNs, URLs, paths, or identities:

    # IDENTITY
    `zef install CSV::Parser`
    `zef install "CSV::Parser:auth<tony-o>:ver<0.1.2>"`
    `zef install "CSV::Parser:ver('0.1.2')"`

    # PATH
    `zef install ./Perl6-Net--HTTP`

    # URL
    `zef -v install git://github.com/ugexe/zef.git`
    `zef -v install https://github.com/ugexe/zef/archive/master.tar.gz`

    # URN
    `zef install github:tony-o:CSV--Parser:0.1.2`

A request may contain any number and combination of these. Paths and URLs will be resolved first so they are available
to fulfill any dependencies of other requested identities.

Note: In the name portion of the B<URN> style a double I<--> indicates a I<::>. This is because modules can have I<->
as part of their name. I<--> is probably valid too, but this makes my life a lot easier for now!

B<Options>

    # Install to a custom locations
    --install-to=<id> # site/home/vendor/perl, or
    -to=<id>          # inst#/home/some/path/custom

    # Load a specific Zef config file
    --config-path=/some/path/config.json

    # Install only the dependency chains of the requested distributions
    --depsonly

    # Install the requested modules regardless of: currently installed versions,
    # test results, or failed dependency installations
    --force

    # Do everything except the actual installations
    --dry

    # Build/Test/Install each dependency serially before proceeding to Build/Test/Install the next
    --serial

    # Disable testing
    --/test

    # Disable fetching dependencies
    --/depends
    --/build-depends
    --/test-depends

=head4 B<uninstall> [*@identities]

Uninstall the specified distributions

Note: Requires a a bleeding edge rakudo (not available in 6.c)

=head4 B<update>

Update the package indexes for all `ContentStorage` backends

Note: Some `ContentStorage` backends, like the default P6C, have an `auto-update` option in `config.json` that can be enabled

=head4 B<upgrade> I<BETA>

Upgrade all installed distributions

=head4 B<search> [$identity]

How these are handled depends on the `ContentStorage` engine used, which by default is the p6c ecosystem and
metacpan. Note that metacpan search is not likely to produce any useful results yet. More documentation will
be available when I have a better idea how to integrate results from these 2 services.

    $ zef -v --cpan search URI

B<Options>

    # Extra details (ex: list dependencies and which ones are installed)
    -v

=head4 B<list> [*@from]

List known available distributions

    $ zef --installed list
    ===> Found via /home/nickl/.rakudobrew/moar-nom/install/share/perl6/site
    CSV::Parser:ver('0.1.2'):auth('github:tony-o')
    Zef:auth('github:ugexe')
    ===> Found via /home/nickl/.rakudobrew/moar-nom/install/share/perl6
    CORE:ver('6.c'):auth('perl')

Note that not every `ContentStorage` may provide such a list, and such lists may only
be a subset. For example: we don't have a way to get a list of every distribution stored
on metacpan, but we *can* get the $x most recent additions (we use 100 for now)

[C<@from>] allows you to show results from specific storages only:

    zef --installed list perl   # Only list modules installed by rakudo itself

    zef list cpan               # Only show available modules from the content storage
    zef list p6c                # with a name field of `cpan` in the configuration
    zef list cached             # (be sure the content storage is enabled in config)

Otherwise results from all enabled content storages will be returned.

B<Options>

    # Only list installed distributions
    --installed

    # Additionally list the modules of discovered distributions
    -v

=head4 B<rdepends> [$identity]

List available distributions that directly depend on C<$identity>

    $ zef rdepends Net::HTTP
    Minecraft-Tools:ver('0.1.0')
    LendingClub:ver('0.1.0')

=head4 B<fetch> [*@identities]

Fetches candidates for given identities

=head4 B<test> [*@paths]

Run tests on each distribution located at [C<@paths>]

=head4 B<build> [*@paths]

Run the Build.pm6 file located in the given [C<@paths>]

If you currently want to create a build hook, put the following dependency-free boilerplate
in a file named `Build.pm6` at the root of your distribution:

    class Builder {
        method build($dist-path) {
            # do build stuff to your module
            # which is located at $dist-path
        }

        # Only needed for panda compatability
        method isa($what) {
            return True if $what.^name eq 'Panda::Builder';
            callsame;
        }
    }

NOTE: You may use installed modules inside the build hook, but of course those modules
must be listed in the `META6.json` file in either the "build-depends" or "depends"
section, as appropiate.

Set the env variable B<ZEF_BUILDPM_DEBUG=1> for additional debugging information

I<Note: In the future a more appropriate hooking solution will replace this>

=head4 B<look> [$identity]

Fetches the requested distribution and any dependencies (if requested), changes the directory to that of the fetched
distribution, and then stops program execution. This allows you modify or look at the source code before manually
continuing the install via `zef install .`

Note that the path to any dependencies that needed to be fetched will be set in env at B<PERL6LIB>, so you should
be able to run any build scripts, tests, or complete a manual install without having to specify their locations.

=head4 B<nuke> [RootDir | TempDir | StoreDir]

Deletes all paths in the specific configuration directory

=head4 B<nuke> [site | home]

Deletes all paths that are rooted in the prefix of the matching CompUnit::Repository name

    # uninstall all modules
    $ zef nuke site home

=head2 Output Verbosity

You can control the logging level using the following flags:

    # More/less detailed output
    --error, --warn, --info (default), --verbose (-v), --debug

=head2 Plugins, Service Locator, and Configuration

See the root zef directory for config.json. Each phase module will attempt to load/use each plugin in order.
More details to be made available in time, but they are fairly simple and the code itself should provide enough
insight to get something done.

Plugins can be enabled and disabled from the command line. The flags to do this are based on the configuration
values for each plugin. So I<--cpan> (field `short-name`) and I<--Zef::ContentStorage::CPAN> (field `module`) would
each set I<"enabled" : 1>.  Conversely I<--/cpan> and I<--/Zef::ContentStorage::CPAN> would set I<"enabled" : 0>

See the configuration file in L<resources/config.json|https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/resources/config.json> for a
little more information on how plugins are invoked.

You can see debug output related to plugins by setting the env variable B<ZEF_PLUGIN_DEBUG=1>

=head1 FAQ

=head3 CPAN?

The functionality is mostly there. The API to search and find a specific module needs more work, but currently can execute
a query and takes a matching distribution name with a matching (or newest) version. It can also download, extract, and
install as well. Other than polishing up the search API access it needs metacpan itself to host Perl6 distributions.

You can enable it by setting I<"enabled" : 1> in the config under the ContentStorage::CPAN plugin, or temporarily
by passing the flag I<--cpan>

    # Search metacpan in addition to other configuration defaults
    $ zef -v --cpan search CSV::Parser

    # Same as above, but disables the default ecosystem `p6c`
    $ zef -v --cpan --/p6c search CSV::Parser

=head3 Proxy support?

All the default fetching plugins have proxy support

=head3 Custom installation locations?

Pass a path to the I<-to> / I<--install-to> option and prefix the path with `inst#` (unless you know what you're doing)

    $ zef -to="inst#/home/perl6/custom" install Text::Table::Simple
    ===> Searching for: Text::Table::Simple
    ===> Testing: Text::Table::Simple:ver('0.0.3'):auth('github:ugexe')
    ===> Testing [OK] for Text::Table::Simple:ver('0.0.3'):auth('github:ugexe')
    ===> Installing: Text::Table::Simple:ver('0.0.3'):auth('github:ugexe')

To make the custom location discoverable:

    # Set the PERL6LIB env:
    $ PERL6LIB="inst#/home/perl6/custom" perl6 -e "use Text::Table::Simple; say 'ok'"
    ok

    # or simply include it as needed
    $ perl6 -Iinst#/home/perl6/custom -e "use Text::Table::Simple; say 'ok'"
    ok
