=head1 Installation

=head4 Rakudobrew

To install it via rakudobrew, please use the following command:

    $ rakudobrew build-zef

=head4 Manual

    $ git clone https://github.com/ugexe/zef.git
    $ cd zef
    $ perl6 -Ilib bin/zef install .

=head1 USAGE

    # duh
    zef install CSV::Parser

    # search for distribution names matching `CSV::Parser`
    zef search CSV::Parser

    # detailed information for a matching distribution
    zef info CSV::Parser

    # list known available distributions
    zef list

    # test project in current directory    
    zef test .

    # fetch a specific module only
    zef fetch CSV::Parser

    # fetch a module, then shell into its local path
    zef look CSV::Parser

    # smoke test modules from all content storages
    zef smoke

=head2 Notice

Still Beta level software. The process of implementing all of the previous features, test suite, and documentation is
still in the works (see an older readme to see expected full feature set). No real work has been done porting over the
old CLI overlay from the previous version of Zef, so the output is rather bleh.

=head2 More CLI

=head4 B<install> [*@identities]

Note: The install process does not install anything until all other phases have completed. So if A requires B,
and a user has requested to C<install A>, it would download A and B, possibly Build A and B, test A and B,
and then finally install A and B but only if A and B passed all their tests. For instance: if A failed its
tests then B will not be installed (even if it passed its own tests) without force.

[C<@identities>] can be in the form of a file path (starting with B<.> or B</>), URNs, URLs, paths, or identities:

    # URN
    `zef install CSV-Parser`
    `zef install github:tony-o:CSV--Parser:0.1.2`
    `zef install CSV-Parser:0.1.2`

    # IDENTITY
    `zef install CSV::Parser`
    `zef install "CSV::Parser:auth<tony-o>:ver<0.1.2>"`
    `zef install "CSV::Parser:ver('0.1.2')"`

    # PATH
    `zef install ./Perl6-Net--HTTP`

    # URL
    `zef -v install git://github.com/ugexe/zef.git`
    `zef -v install https://github.com/ugexe/zef/archive/master.tar.gz`

A request may contain any number and combination of these. Paths and URLs will be resolved first so they are available
to fulfill any dependencies of other requested identities.

Note: In the name portion of the B<URN> style a double I<--> indicates a I<::>. This is because modules can have I<->
as part of their name. I<--> is probably valid too, but this makes my life a lot easier for now!

B<Options>
    
    # install to a location determined by short-id
    --install-to=<id> # site/home/vendor/perl

    # Install only the dependency chains of the requested distributions
    --depsonly

    # More detailed output
    --verbose

    # install the requested modules regardless of: currently installed versions,
    # test results, or failed dependency installations
    --force

    # do everything except the actual installations
    --dry

    # disable testing
    --/test

    # disable fetching dependencies
    --/depends
    --/build-depends
    --/test-depends

=head4 B<uninstall> [*@identities]

Uninstall the specified distributions

Note: Requires a a bleeding edge rakudo (not available in 6.c)

=head4 B<update>

Update the package indexes for all `ContentStorage` backends

=head4 B<search> [$identity]

How these are handled depends on the `ContentStorage` engine used, which by default is the p6c ecosystem and
metacpan. Note that metacpan search is not likely to produce any useful results yet. More documentation will
be available when I have a better idea how to integrate results from these 2 services.

    # with cpan enabled...
    $ zef -v search URI

B<Options>

    # Extra details (ex: list dependencies and which ones are installed)
    -v

=head4 B<list> [*@from]

List known available distributions

    $ zef --installed list
    ===> Found via /home/nickl/.rakudobrew/moar-nom/install/share/perl6/site
    CSV::Parser:ver('0.1.2'):auth('github:tony-o')
    Zef:auth('github:ugexe')
    ===> Found via /home/nickl/.rakudobrew/moar-nom/install/share/perl6
    CORE:ver('6.c'):auth('perl')

Note that not every `ContentStorage` may provide such a list, and such lists may only
be a subset. For example: we don't have a way to get a list of every distribution stored
on metacpan, but we *can* get the $x most recent additions (we use 100 for now)

[C<@from>] allows you to show results from specific storages only:

    zef --installed list perl   # Only list modules installed by rakudo itself

    zef list cpan               # Only show available modules from the content storage
                                # with a name field of `cpan` in the configuration
                                # (plugin must not be set to `"enabled" : 0`)

Otherwise results from all enabled content storages will be returned.

B<Options>

    # Only list installed distributions
    --installed

    # Additionally list the modules of discovered distributions
    -v

=head4 B<fetch> [*@identities]

Fetches candidates for given identities, including any dependencies (if requested)

=head4 B<look> [$identity]

Fetches the requested distribution and any dependencies (if requested), changes the directory to that of the fetched
distribution, and then stops program execution. This allows you modify or look at the source code before manually
continuing the install via `zef install .`

Note that the path to any dependencies that needed to be fetched will be set in env at B<PERL6LIB>, so you should
be able to run any build scripts, tests, or complete a manual install without having to specify their locations.

=head2 Plugins and Configuration

See the root zef directory for config.json. Each phase module will attempt to load/use each plugin in order.
More details to be made available in time, but they are fairly simple and the code itself should provide enough
insight to get something done.

See the configuration file in L<resources/config.json|https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/resources/config.json> for a
little more information on how plugins are invoked.

You can see debug output related to plugins by setting the env variable B<ZEF_PLUGIN_DEBUG=1>

=head1 FAQ

=head3 CPAN?

The functionality is mostly there. The API to search and find a specific module needs more work, but currently can execute
a query and takes a matching distribution name with a matching (or newest) version. It can also download, extract, and
install as well. Other than polishing up the search API access it needs metacpan itself to host Perl6 distributions.

You can enable it by setting I<"enabled" : 1> in the config under the ContentStorage::CPAN plugin, or temporarily by passing a flag:

    # flag
    -CContentStorage="cpan.enabled=1"

    # examples
    `zef -v -CContentStorage="cpan.enabled=1" search CSV::Parser`
    `zef -v -CContentStorage="cpan.enabled=1" install CSV::Parser`

=head3 Proxy support?

All the default fetching plugins have proxy support
