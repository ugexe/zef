    =head1 Description

    A class that coordinates the various stages of a raku distribution installation workflow based on
    various configuration parameters.

    Additionally it provides slightly higher level facilities for fetching, extracting, etc, than the
    e.g. C<Zef::Fetch>, C<Zef::Extract>, etc modules it uses underneath. For example C<Zef::Client.fetch> 
    may run an extraction step unlike C<Zef::Fetch.fetch>, since the former is in the context of a distribution
    (i.e. we want the distribution at the specific commit/tag, not the HEAD immediately after fetching).

    =head1 Methods

    =head2 method find-candidates

        method find-candidates(*@identities ($, *@) --> Array[Candidate])

    Searches all repositories via C<Zef::Repository> and returns a matching C<Candidate> / distribution for each supplied
    identity. Generally this is used to find the top level distributions requested, such as C<Foo> in C<zef install Foo>.

    =head2 method find-candidates

        method find-prereq-candidates(Bool :$skip-installed = True, *@candis ($, *@) --> Array[Candidate])

    Similar to C<method find-candidates> but returns matching a matching C<Candidate> for each dependency of the supplied
    identities. Generally this is used to recursively discover and determine the dependencies of the identities requested.
    If C<$skip-installed> is set to C<False> it will potentially install a newer version of an already installed matching
    dependency (without uninstalling the previous version). It also skips any identity matching of C<@.ignore>, which allows
    getting past an unresolvable dependency ala `zef install Inline::Perl5 --ignore="perl"`.

    Returns an C<Array> of C<Candidate> that fulfill the dependency requirements of C<@identities>.

    =head2 method search

        method search(*@identities ($, *@), *%fields, Bool :$strict = False --> Array[Candidate])

    Resolves each identity in C<@identities> to all of its matching C<Candidates> from all backends via C<Zef::Repository> (with C<$max-results>
    applying to each individual backend). If C<$strict> is C<False> then it will consider partial matches on module short-names (i.e. 'zef search HTTP'
    will get results for e.g. C<HTTP::UserAgent>).

    =head2 method fetch

        method fetch(*@candidates ($, *@) --> Array[Candidate])

    Fetches a distribution from some location, and unpacks/extracts it to a temporary location to be used be cached, tested,
    installed, etc. It effective combines the functionality of C<Zef::Fetch.fetch> and C<Zef::Extract.extract> into a single
    method as there isn't yet a useful reason to have workflows that work with compressed archives/packages. Fetches up to
    C<$.fetch-degree> different C<@candidates> in parallel.

    Anytime a distribution is fetched it will call C<.store(@distributions)> on any C<Zef::Repository> that supports it (usually
    just C<Zef::Repository::LocalCache>).

    File are saved to the C<TempDir> setting in C<resources/config.json>, and extracted to the C<$.cache> directory (the C<StoreDir>
    setting in C<resources/config.json>).

    Returns an C<Array> of C<Candidate> containing the successfully fetched results.

    =head2 method build

        method build(*@candidates ($, *@) --> Array[Candidate])

    Runs the build process on each C<@candidates> that the backends for C<Zef::Build> know how to process. Builds up to C<$.build-degree>
    different C<@candidates> in parallel.

    Returns an C<Array> of C<Candidate> with each C<.build-results> set appropriately.

    =head2 method test

        method test(*@candidates ($, *@) --> Array[Candidate])

    Runs the test process on each C<@candidates> via the backends of C<Zef::Test>. Tests up to C<$.test-degree> different
    C<@candidates> in parallel.

    Returns an C<Array> of C<Candidate> with each C<.test-results> set appropriately.

    =head2 method uninstall

        method uninstall(CompUnit::Repository :@from!, *@identities --> Array[Candidate])

    Searches each C<CompUnit::Repository> in C<@from> for each C<@identities> and uninstalls any matching distributions.
    For instance uninstalling C<zef> could potentially uninstall multiple versions, whereas uninstall C<zef:ver("0.9.4")> would
    only uninstall that specific version.

    Returns an C<Array> containing each uninstalled C<Candidate>.

    =head2 method install

        method install(:@curs, *@candidates ($, *@) --> Array[Candidate])

    Install a C<Candidate> containing a C<Distribution> to each C<CompUnit::Repository> in C<@curs>.

    Returns an C<Array> containing each successfully installed C<Candidate>.

    =head2 method make-install

        method make-install(CompUnit::Repository :@to!, Bool :$fetch = True, Bool :$build = True, Bool :$test  = True, Bool :$dry, Bool :$serial, *@candidates ($, *@), *%_)

    The 'do everything but resolve dependencies' method. You essentially figure out all the C<Candidate> you need to install
    (dependencies, etc) and pass them to this method. Its similar to C<method install> except it also handles calling C<method fetch>
    (if C<$fetch> is C<True>), C<method build> (if C<$build> is C<True>), and C<method test> (if <$test> is C<True>). If C<$dry> is
    C<True> then the final step of calling C<method install> (which moves the modules to where C<raku> will see them) will be skipped.
    If <$serial> is C<True> then each C<Candidate> will be installed after it passes its own tests (instead of the default behavior of
    only installing if all C<Candidate>, including dependencies, pass their tests).

    =head2 method list-rev-depends

        method list-rev-depends($identity, Bool :$indirect --> Array[Candidate])

    Return an C<Array> of C<Candidate> of all distribution that directly depend on C<$identity>. If C<$indirect> is C<True> then it
    additionally returns distributions that indirectly / transitively depend on C<$identity>

    =head2 method list-available

        method list-available(*@recommendation-manager-names --> Array[Candidate])

    Returns an C<Array> of C<Candidate> for every distribution from every repository / recommendation-manager with a name (as
    set in C<resources/config.json>) matching any of those in C<@recommendation-manager-names> (or all repositories if no names
    are supplied). Note some non-standard repositories may not support listing all available distributions.

    =head2 method list-installed

        method list-installed(*@curis --> Array[Candidate])

    Returns an C<Array> of C<Candidate> for each Raku distribution installed to each C<CompUnit::Repository::Installation> C<@curis>
    (or all known C<CompUnit::Repository::Installation> if no C<@curis> are supplied).

    =head2 method list-leaves

        method list-leaves(--> Array[Candidate])

    Returns an C<Array> of C<Candidate> for each installed distributions that nothing else appears to depend on. 

    =head2 method list-dependencies

        method list-dependencies(*@candis --> Array[DependencySpecification])

    Returns an C<Array> of C<Zef::Distribution::DependencySpecification> and // or C<Zef::Distribution::DependencySpecification::Any>
    for each C<@candis> distributions various dependency requirements.

    If C<$.depends> is set to C<False> then runtime dependencies will be ignored.
    If C<$.test-depends> is set to C<False> then test dependencies will be ignored.
    If C<$.build-depends> is set to C<False> then build dependencies will be ignored.

    =head2 method resolve

        method resolve($spec, CompUnit::Repository :@at --> Array[Candidate])

    Returns the best matching distributions from installed sources for the given C<$spec>, in preferred order (highest api
    version and highest version) from each C<CompUnit::Repository> in C<@at> (or all known C<CompUnit::Repository> if C<@at>
    is not set). C<$spec> should be either a C<Zef::Distribution::DependencySpecification> or C<Zef::Distribution::DependencySpecification::Any>.

    =head2 method is-installed

        multi method is-installed(Str $spec, |c --> Bool:D)
        multi method is-installed(Zef::Distribution::DependencySpecification::Any $spec, |c --> Bool:D)
        multi method is-installed(Zef::Distribution::DependencySpecification $spec, |c --> Bool:D)

    Returns C<True> if the requested C<$spec> is installed. The logic it uses to decide if something is installed is based on
    the C<$spec.from-matcher>: C<foo:from<bin>> will search C<$PATH> for C<foo>, C<foo:from<native>> will check if C<NativeCall>
    can see an e.g. C<libfoo.so> or C<foo.dll>, and everything else will be looked up as a C<foo> raku module.

    =head2 method sort-candidates

        method sort-candidates(@candis --> Array[Candidate])

    Does a topological sort of C<@candis> based on their various dependency fields and C<$.depends>/C<$.test-depends>/C<$.build-depends>.
