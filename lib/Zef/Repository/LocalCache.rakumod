    =subtitle A local caching implementation of the Repository interface

    =head1 Synopsis

    =begin code :lang<raku>

        use Zef::Fetch;
        use Zef::Repository::LocalCache;

        # Point cache at default zef cache so there are likely some distributions to see
        my $cache = $*HOME.child(".zef/store");
        my $repo  = Zef::Repository::LocalCache.new(:$cache);

        # Print out all available distributions from this repository
        say $_.dist.identity for $repo.available;

    =end code

    =head1 Description

    The C<Repository> zef uses for its local cache. It is intended to keep track of contents of a directory full
    of raku distributions. It provides the optional C<Repository> method C<store> which allows it to save/copy
    any modules downloaded by other repositories.

    Note: distributions installed from local file paths (i.e. C<zef install ./my-module>) will not be cached
    since local development of modules often occurs without immediately bumping versions (and thus a stale
    version would soon get cached).

    Note: THIS IS PROBABLY NOT ANY MORE EFFICIENT THAN ::Ecosystems BASED REPOSITORIES
    At one time json parsing/writing was slow enough that parts of this implementation were faster. Now it is mostly
    just useful for dynamically generating the MANIFEST.zef from the directory structure this repository expects
    instead of fetching a file like C<Zef::Repository::Ecosystems>.

    =head1 Methods

    =head2 method search

        method search(Bool :$strict, *@identities ($, *@), *%fields --> Array[Candidate])

    Resolves each identity in C<@identities> to all of its matching C<Candidates>. If C<$strict> is C<False> then it will
    consider partial matches on module short-names (i.e. 'zef search HTTP' will get results for e.g. C<HTTP::UserAgent>).

    =head2 method available

        method available(*@plugins --> Array[Candidate])

    Returns an C<Array> of all C<Candidate> provided by this repository instance (i.e. all distributions in the local cache).

    =head2 method update

        method update(--> Nil)

    Attempts to update the local file / database using the first of C<@.mirrors> that successfully fetches.

    =head2 method store

        method store(*@dists --> Nil)

    Attempts to store/save/cache each C<@dist>. Generally this is called when a module is fetched from e.g. cpan so that this
    module can cache it locally for next time. Note distributions fetched from local paths (i.e. `zef install .`) do not generally get passed to this method.
